/*
Outline:
Resturant Bill:
1. create an void main function that takes in 2 doubles(tax and tip percentage)

2. create 4 meal costs as doubles
double salad = 9.95;
double soup = 4.55;
double sandwich = 12.25;
double pizza = 22.35;

3. create a random method to select a meal cost. Maybe associate each meal with a number value 0-3. create an if statement to calculate that.

4. calculate total bill cost. 
tip =/ 100;
tip=*mealcost;
tax =/ 100;
tax =* mealcost;
total = mealcost + tax + tip

5. print out meal, tax, tip and total bill
